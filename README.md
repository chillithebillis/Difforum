# Difforum: Deforum-style animation for ComfyUI

Keyframe animation driven by math expressions, with camera moves, audio
reactivity and prompt travel. It brings the Deforum workflow to current models
(SD1.5, SDXL, **Flux**, SD3.5, Wan 2.2) and Python 3.12+.

## Why it exists

The original [Deforum](https://github.com/deforum-art/sd-webui-deforum) is hard
to run today: its library refuses Python 3.12, it's tied to SD1.5-era img2img,
and the frame-by-frame loop flickers. Difforum rebuilds the same ideas from
scratch and fixes those problems.

What you get:

- The same `0:(expr)` keyframe syntax (`sin`, `cos`, `t`, audio variables),
  camera schedules, audio reactivity and prompt travel.
- A model-agnostic sampler that takes plain ComfyUI `MODEL/VAE/CONDITIONING`, so
  you can drop in SDXL, **Flux**, SD3.5 or an SD-Turbo/LCM model instead of
  2023-era SD1.5. No lock-in.
- Three render paths over one control layer: **Classic+** (depth-aware warp,
  re-diffuse, LAB colour match), **Hybrid** (drives Wan 2.2 VACE), and
  **AnimateDiff** (feeds prompt travel and schedules into AnimateDiff-Evolved).
- No `eval()`, no exotic dependencies (safe AST evaluator, numpy FFT audio, torch
  warps), 11 test suites, and a clean install on Python 3.12 and the Comfy Registry.

See [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) for the architecture and [REALTIME.md](REALTIME.md)
for the live-performance direction.

## Status

**Phase 1 - Schedule Engine (done).** GPU-free. The animation "brain":

| Node | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Difforum · Anim Setup** | Global params (size, fps, frames, seed) shared downstream |
| **Difforum · Schedule** | Parses `0:(expr), 60:(expr)` into a per-frame curve |
| **Difforum · Sample Schedule** | Reads a curve value at one frame |
| **Difforum · Schedule Info** | Debug summary + ASCII sparkline of a curve |
| **Difforum · Schedule Plot** | Renders the computed curve as an IMAGE (Preview-ready) |

**Phase Audio - Reactivity (done).** Pure numpy (no librosa):

| Node | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Difforum · Audio Analyzer** | AUDIO → per-frame curves `amp/low/mid/high/onset/beat` |
| **Difforum · Audio Schedule (reactive)** | Turn a band into a ready curve (bass-pump, beat-pulse…) for any schedule input |

Connect Audio Analyzer's `audio_curves` to Schedule's `audio` input, then use
the curve names in expressions: `0:(0.2 + 0.8*amp)`, `0:(beat*0.6)`,
`0:(2*low - high)`.

**Hybrid foundation + render (done).**

| Node | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Difforum · Camera Move (presets)** | Intuitive camera: pick a move (zoom/orbit/spiral/shake…) + speed + intensity |
| **Difforum · Camera (advanced)** | Deforum 2D/3D camera schedules → per-frame poses (audio-reactive) |
| **Difforum · Model Profile** | Auto-resolve model/quant/res/steps for the GPU (12→32GB+, GGUF) |
| **Difforum · Model Catalog** | Classic, trainable model recipes + download/training guide |
| **Difforum · Warp (2D/3D)** | Classic Deforum warp + occlusion mask (force_2d / force_3d) |
| **Difforum · Feedback Sampler** | Classic+ video: warp→re-diffuse→colour-match (LAB/RGB) loop (SD1.5/SDXL) |
| **Difforum · Guide Builder** | Warp anchor along camera path → guide batch for Wan 2.2 VACE |
| **Difforum · Prompt Scenes (travel)** | Prompt travel by scenes - one text box per scene, auto-spaced |
| **Difforum · Prompt Schedule (travel)** | Prompt travel from a `frame: prompt` schedule |
| **Difforum · Prompt Batch (→ AnimateDiff)** | Stacks prompt travel into one batched CONDITIONING for AnimateDiff |

**Effects (done).** Mirror, kaleidoscope and smooth temporal trails:

| Node | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Difforum · Symmetry / Kaleidoscope** | Mirror H/V, 4-fold quad, or N-segment kaleidoscope on a frame or batch |
| **Difforum · Echo Trails** | Long-exposure motion trails across a frame batch (smooth, hypnotic) |

**VJ look (done).** Grade video footage for live visuals, no model required:

| Node | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Difforum · VJ Look (presets)** | One-shot grade: neon / cinematic / vaporwave / film / noir / psychedelic, with an intensity that an audio schedule can pulse to the beat |
| **Difforum · Colour Grade** | Exposure, contrast, saturation, white balance, lift/gamma/gain |
| **Difforum · Glow** | Neon bloom (blur the bright areas, screen-blend them back) |

These are plain IMAGE to IMAGE, so they work on a still, a feedback render or a
whole footage batch. Drop them after a Load Video for the polished VJ look
(`difforum_vj_footage.json`), with no checkpoint needed.

Symmetry is also built into the **Feedback Sampler** (`symmetry` + `symmetry_segments`):
applied *inside* the loop it compounds each frame and the diffusion heals the
seams, giving a living kaleidoscope (`difforum_mesmerize_kaleidoscope.json`).

![Difforum living kaleidoscope](examples/difforum_kaleidoscope.gif)

*In-loop kaleidoscope symmetry on an SD1.5 feedback render, smoothed with Echo
Trails. The pattern folds every frame and the diffusion reseals the seams, so it
keeps growing on itself. Made entirely with the Difforum nodes.*

Three render paths: **Classic+** (Feedback Sampler - self-contained Deforum
video), **Hybrid** (Guide Builder → your Wan 2.2 VACE graph), and **AnimateDiff**
(Prompt Batch → AnimateDiff-Evolved for native motion + Difforum control). See
DESIGN.md §7. Modern bases (SDXL / Flux / SD3.5) drop into the Feedback Sampler -
it is model-agnostic. AnimateDiff motion modules need AnimateDiff's own batch
sampler (the `difforum_animatediff_sd15.json` template wires it).

The 3D warp exposes `translation_scale` to tune motion vs. the depth estimator's
(non-metric) range; colour coherence does perceptual **LAB** matching by default.

![Difforum hybrid guide preview](examples/difforum_guide_demo.gif)

*Hybrid bridge: the Guide Builder warps one anchor image along the camera path
into the guide batch a Wan 2.2 VACE graph consumes (camera by Difforum, fill by Wan).*

> **Black output?** Some ComfyUI builds make SD1.5 fp16 produce NaN (all-black
> frames). Launch ComfyUI with `--force-fp32` - it's a base-model precision
> issue, not Difforum.

## Install

**Manual / git (local or self-hosted):**

```bash
cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes
git clone https://github.com/chillithebillis/Difforum.git difforum
# deps are minimal (numpy, already present); only needed for a bare env:
pip install -r difforum/requirements.txt
```

Restart ComfyUI; the console prints `[Difforum] loaded N nodes`.

**ComfyUI Manager:** *Custom Nodes Manager* → install via Git URL with the repo
above (or by name once published to the registry).

**Comfy Registry:** Difforum is registry-ready via `pyproject.toml` (no heavy or
version-locked deps, so it builds on the cloud's Python 3.12). To publish:

```bash
pip install comfy-cli
comfy node publish        # uploads to the Comfy Registry
```

**Cloud GPU (self-host):** the quickest way to run Difforum in the cloud today is
a managed GPU host like [RunPod](https://www.runpod.io) or [Vast.ai](https://vast.ai):
spin up a ComfyUI template, then in the Manager install via the Git URL above (or
`git clone` into `custom_nodes`). Everything runs with no gatekeeping.

**Comfy Cloud** runs a curated set of vetted node packs, so a node has to be
reviewed and added by the Comfy team before it works there. Publishing to the
Registry is the first step; getting onto Comfy Cloud is their manual curation. Use
a self-host GPU (above) in the meantime.

## Example workflows

In `examples/` (drag the `.json` onto the ComfyUI canvas):

Templates exercise every node. Regenerate with
`python examples/_build_examples.py`.

**Prompt pack:** [`examples/PROMPTS.md`](examples/PROMPTS.md) has 10 ready-to-paste
prompt-travel presets (Cosmic Voyage, Sacred Geometry kaleidoscope, Neon City,
Elemental Shift, Audio-reactive Pulse and more) with suggested camera, strength
and symmetry settings for each.

**Every workflow has a yellow Note on the canvas** listing exactly which models
to download and the folder they go in, so you can set up without guessing.

## Models & downloads

Quick reference for the files the templates ask for (drop each in the folder
shown under your ComfyUI `models/` directory):

| Model | Folder | Where |
|---|---|---|
| SD1.5 checkpoint (DreamShaper 8) | `checkpoints` | civitai.com/models/4384 |
| SDXL checkpoint (Juggernaut XL) | `checkpoints` | civitai.com (search "Juggernaut XL") |
| Flux.1-dev fp8 / schnell | `checkpoints` or `unet` | hf: Comfy-Org/flux1-dev, black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-schnell |
| SD-Turbo / LCM-LoRA (fast) | `checkpoints` / `loras` | hf: stabilityai/sd-turbo, latent-consistency/lcm-lora-sdv1-5 |
| Wan 2.2 5B GGUF + umt5 + wan vae | `unet` / `text_encoders` / `vae` | hf: QuantStack/Wan2.2-TI2V-5B-GGUF, Comfy-Org/Wan_2.1_ComfyUI_repackaged |
| IP-Adapter + CLIP-Vision (ViT-H) | `ipadapter` / `clip_vision` | hf: h94/IP-Adapter |
| QR Code Monster ControlNet | `controlnet` | hf: monster-labs/control_v1p_sd15_qrcode_monster |
| Tile / depth ControlNet (SD1.5) | `controlnet` | hf: comfyanonymous/ControlNet-v1-1_fp16_safetensors |
| AnimateDiff motion module (mm_sd15_v3) | `animatediff_models` | hf: guoyww/animatediff |

Helper nodes some templates use: ComfyUI-VideoHelperSuite (MP4),
ComfyUI-Frame-Interpolation (RIFE), ComfyUI_IPAdapter_plus, ComfyUI-GGUF,
ComfyUI-WanVideoWrapper, ComfyUI-AnimateDiff-Evolved. The **intuitive nodes**
(`Camera Move` presets, `Prompt Scenes`) are wired into `intuitive_controls`,
`turbo_live` and `camera_warp` for an easier start.

## Quality & coherence tips

- **Lock the style with IPAdapter.** Patch the checkpoint's MODEL through
  IPAdapter (a reference image) *before* the Feedback Sampler - it keeps colour
  and style stable across the whole clip (see `difforum_ipadapter_coherent.json`).
- **ControlNet must match the base family** (SD1.5↔SD1.5, SDXL↔SDXL). Feed the
  Feedback Sampler's `control_net` for structure-guided feedback; lower
  `control_strength` (~0.3-0.5) if it feels too rigid.
- **Use a modern base.** SDXL / Flux / SD3.5 in the Feedback Sampler look far
  cleaner than SD1.5 - it's model-agnostic, just swap the checkpoint.
- **Colour drift?** Keep `color_mode = lab` (default) and `color_coherence`
  around 0.7-0.9. **Flicker?** Lower per-frame `strength` (denoise) to ~0.4-0.5.
- **Audio-reactive** is one node: `Difforum · Audio Schedule` turns a band
  (bass/beat/onset) into a curve for zoom, strength, cfg - any schedule input.
- **Illusions / hidden patterns:** feed a grayscale pattern (spiral, logo, mask)
  to `control_image` with **QR Code Monster** ControlNet - it stays locked in the
  scene while the loop morphs around it (`difforum_qrcode_illusion.json`).
- **Mesmerizing / symmetric video:** set the Feedback Sampler's `symmetry` to
  `kaleidoscope` (or `mirror_h/v/quad`) so it folds *inside* the loop - the
  diffusion heals the seams and the pattern grows on itself. Add **Echo Trails**
  after the sampler for smooth motion blur (`difforum_mesmerize_kaleidoscope.json`).
  A slow rotation/zoom on the camera keeps feeding the kaleidoscope new material.

## Realtime / live

The **Difforum Live Sampler** is a native realtime engine. Stock ComfyUI re-runs
the graph per "Queue Prompt", so the Live Sampler keeps the model resident and
runs its own **internal loop**: each tick it warps (camera), folds (symmetry),
re-diffuses 1-2 steps (Turbo/LCM) and color-matches, **streaming a live preview
into the node** as it goes. Queue once and watch it generate, no external runtime.

- Pair with a **few-step model** (SD-Turbo / SDXL-Turbo / LCM / DMD2), 1-2 steps,
  cfg ~1, at 512px for live FPS. The `difforum_realtime_live.json` template wires
  a Turbo checkpoint to the Live Sampler with a kaleidoscope on.
- **Live webcam ("magic mirror"):** set `live_source` to `0` (webcam device) or a
  video path and the loop stylizes the live feed, kaleidoscoping the camera in
  realtime. `source_blend` mixes camera vs feedback (needs `opencv-python`).
- Live output to a VJ app: set `stream_dir` (writes frames to a folder that
  OBS/Resolume/ffmpeg can read live) or `spout_name` (Spout, needs `SpoutGL`).
- For the highest FPS, add **[TensorRT](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI_TensorRT)**
  + **TAESD** (tiny VAE). Map physical knobs/faders with MIDI/OSC.

If you specifically need browser/WebRTC streaming, the same nodes can run under
ComfyStream. Full plan: [REALTIME.md](REALTIME.md).

## Schedule syntax

Deforum-compatible. Each keyframe holds a math expression:

```
0:(0), 60:(0.5*sin(2*pi*t/30)), 120:(1.0)
```

Variables: `t`/`f` (frame), `s` (seconds), `fps`, `max_f`, `pi`, `e`, `tau`,
plus any audio curve (e.g. `amp`, `low`, `mid`, `high`) when an audio input is
connected. Functions: `sin cos tan asin acos atan atan2 sinh cosh tanh abs
sqrt exp log log10 pow floor ceil round min max sign clamp clip lerp
smoothstep`. Ternaries work: `t if t > 30 else 0`.

Expressions are evaluated with a whitelisted AST walker - **no `eval()` of
arbitrary code**, no external dependencies.

Easing between keyframes: `linear`, `ease_in`, `ease_out`, `ease_in_out`, `step`.

## Develop / test

No GPU or ComfyUI needed - 11 suites cover the engine, warp, colour, effects, look,
model catalog, and a full end-to-end orchestration (stub diffusion):

```powershell
$py = "D:\ComfyUI-victor\venv\Scripts\python.exe"
foreach ($t in "core","audio","hybrid","models","warp","color","effects","look","prompt","plot","integration") {
  & $py "custom_nodes\difforum\tests\test_$t.py"
}
```

`test_integration.py` wires every node together (AnimSetup → Audio → Camera →
Schedule → Feedback Sampler → frames, plus the Guide Builder hybrid path) and
runs the real production code path with a stub model/VAE - so the only thing
swapped for a real render is the checkpoint inside ComfyUI.

After changes, restart ComfyUI fully to reload the nodes (look for
`[Difforum] loaded N nodes` in the console).
